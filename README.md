Physics Libary is a smal learning Project of mine and not finished at all. 

I dont realy know yet how to use GitHub, but im working on it. 

If you like it and want to use it feel free, rework it yourself if you want, 
You can critisise it, too. I will try to learn from it. 

you can also contribute, but my guess is: It will be just another part of GitHubs Junk Pile :D
